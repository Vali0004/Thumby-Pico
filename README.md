# Thumby Pico
## Info
    * This is a (mostly) single-header Thumby library, with most of the code being directly compatible.
## Why?
    * I heavily dislike the Arduino IDE, and wanted to use C. So, I did.
## Disclaimer
    This is written in C without a C++ wrapper.
    This means that classes and structs were turned into functions. So instead of ```thumby.clear();```, you'd do ```Thumby_clear();```
