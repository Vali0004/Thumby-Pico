# Thumby-Pico-Single-Header
## Info
    This is a (mostly) single-header Thumby library, with most of the code being directly compatible.
## Disclaimer
    This is written in C without a C++ wrapper.
    This means that classes and structs were turned into functions. So instead of `thumby.clear();`, you'd do `Thumby_clear();`
## Why?
    I heavily dislike the Arduino IDE, and wanted to use C. So, I did.
